# Paddle Game

A [Playdate](https://play.date/) port of a simple single-player Pong-like I wrote several years ago for [PICO-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICO-8).

## Installation

1. Download the zipped game files from [releases](https://github.com/ghall89/playdate-paddle-game/releases/).
2. Upload the zip file to the [Playdate website](https://play.date/account/sideload/).
3. On your Playdate, install the game from the 'Sideloaded' section in Settings > Games

## Controls

Rotate the crank to move the paddle back and forth. Alternatively, you can use left and right on the d-pad.

- A: Start a new game
- B: Increase speed (when controlling paddle with d-pad)

## Building From Source

To build from source, the [Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/) is required.

If you're on a Mac and running the Nova editor, you can build and run the game using the [official Playdate extension](https://sdk.play.date/2.4.2/Inside%20Playdate.html#usingNova)

Otherwise, follow [these instructions](https://sdk.play.date/2.4.2/Inside%20Playdate.html#_compiling_a_project)
